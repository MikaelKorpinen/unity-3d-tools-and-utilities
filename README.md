# unity-3d-tools-and-utilities
tools and utilities to accelerate development of virtual reality games and applications

The project is meant help in the following way.

-Enhance user experience by giving tools and utilities to things like easy object picking from distance.
-Get data about entities and gmaeobjects also to give data about their whereabouts to the user.


The first version is to include targeting system.
Targeting system is based on vector mathematics and can give information about gameobjects and entities for easy object location.
It also has object culling in frustum space, which means that the targeting system only processes stuff that happen inside its own area rather than at scene level.
